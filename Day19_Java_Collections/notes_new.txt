Collections are coming from 

java.util package 

Scanner : This class allows you to read data from the keyboard. 

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

nextLine() -> Used to read a string with spaces

next() -> Reads a single work

nextInt() -> Used to read integer. 

Map interface : this interface is not in collection framework, used to store data w.r.t. Key/Value pairs. 

In this, we have HashTable and HashMap are falling under this category.

Drawback with collections : 

They will not provide security to the data. 

Generics : Provides an opportunity to pass data types at runtime. 
If you want to make any methods as write once and apply for any data type, then we need the help of generics.
Generics will be represented in <T> nontation. 
Means, in place of <T> we can pass any data type.

Advantages : 
____________


   -> Write once and apply for all types

   -> No Typecasting required

   -> Provides security to data.

   -> Reduces the size of the program. 

enums allows you to store group of constants. 

enum obj = [

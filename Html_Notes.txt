Web Applications : 

These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than 
where they are created.  If you want to make any distributed or robust applicaitons, then we
need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as

(i) Scripting Languages

	Scripting languages are languages, that which are interpreted, during runtime they 
	takes lot of time to execute. 

(ii) Programming Languages 

	These are the languages that which are compiled first, during runtime 
	they takes very less time to execute. 

In Web Applications, we can implement both

Client-side and Server-Side scripting 

Client Side scripting, enables you to access the application from the client system. 

No Network Traffic

Execution will be faster. 


In Server-side scripting, 

  -> Enables you to access the application from the server

  -> Execution will be a bit slower

  -> Network traffic is high 

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No security please opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min. security, please opt for both client-side/server-side
		scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High security, plesae opt for server-side scripting ***

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 

	Used to create sample web pages. 

To start with HTML, we need as

<html>
</html> 

<head>
</head> : Used to define the global content for the given page. 

<title> : used to display heading on title bar. 

<title></title> 

<body>
</body> : Contains the actual content for the given page. 

DL -> Definition Language 

   DT -> Definition Term

   DD -> Definition Description 

To place an image, we have to give as

<img src="imagepath" /> 

Anchor tag : Used to link the given page with other page. 

<a href="target_page">targeted page</a>

Forms :

Hibernate 

Hibernate is a java framework that which simplifies the development of java
application to interact with database. It is a opensource, lightweight, 
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool, that which implements specifications of 
Database. 

Why we call as ORM is it maps the backend tables with front-end entity classes. 

Then instead of going to database, we can extract data from model class. 

ORM tool simplifies the data creation, data manipulation and data 
access. 

Advantages of Hibernate
________________________

       (i) Open Source : Hibernate framework is a open source framework.

      (ii) Fast Performance : As performance is fine, because we can implement various levels of cache, 

		as there are 2 types of cache as first level and second level cache. 

     (iii) Database Indepedent Query : 
		
			Hibernate have its own language known as HQL (Hibernate Query Language) that which
		allows to extract data from entity classes. 

      (iv) Automatic Table Creation : 
		Provides feature to create tables automatically.

      (v) Simplifies Complex Joins : 

		Provides various syntaxes to join entities.

     

Hibernate architecture categorized in 4 layers. 


    -> Java Application Layer

    -> Hibernate Framework Layer

    -> Backhand api Layer

    -> Database Layer

To accomplish the above things, we have various elements in hibernate architecture as 

-> SessionFactory

	Is a factory of session and client of ConnectionProvieder. It holds the 2nd level cache of data.
	It comes with org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface

-> Session 

The object provides an interface between the application and data stored in database. It is a short-lived object and wraps the JDBC connection. It is a factory of Transaction, Query and Criteria. 

-> Transaction

	Provides an operational tasks w.r.t. database. it comes with org.hibernate.Transaction package. 

First, you need to define all necessary connectionstring information in 
hibernate.cfg.xml file.

DBMS (Database Management System) 

Database : it is set of interrelated files, stored with min. 
redundancy, to serve many users works concurrently. 

DBMS : The software that which allows you to 
	perform transactions on data like

	(i) Adding New Data

	(ii) Modifying already existing data

	(iii) removing unwanted data 

known as DBMS. 

Objectives : 
____________

	-> Provides an efficient and convinient env, that which allows you to store and retreive data

	-> Granting access on data to users based on their credentials. 

Drawbacks : 
____________


(i) Data Redundancy

(ii) Risk to Data Integrity 

(iii) Data Isolation

(iv) Difficult Access to Data 

(v) Unsatisfactory Security Measures 


Data Model : It is the description of the org. of data in the database. It also describes the relationship among the data and any constraints ;that have to be defined on data. 

Data Models are classified into 2 types known as

1) Object-based logical Model : Focuses on describing the data, and the relationship among the data and any constraints defined. 

2) Record-based logical model : Focuses on describing the data structure and the access techniques in the DBMS. 

Object-baed Logical model : 

The ER model : It is based on the real world perception that comprises a collection of objects or entites and the relationships among the data. 


Entity is a thing, that which can be identified. 

Attribute : The property of given entity. 

Relationship is an association among various entities. 

There are various types of attributes as

  Employ(Empno,Name,Gender,Email,PhoneNo,
	Salary,GrossPay,NetPay,Tax,Pf)

  -> Normal Attributes  : empno,Name,Gender

  -> Derived Attributes : GrossPay,tax,Pf,netPay

  -> MultiValued Attributes : Email, PhoneNo

Types of relationships : 
__________________________

There are 3 types of relationships known as

	(i) One-to-One

	(ii) One-to-Many

	(iii) Many-to-Many 

Keys : A RDBMS uses associative addressing, that is it identifies and lcoates rows by value. The physical address is transparent to the user. Therefore, relational system require keys. 

Employ(Empno,Name,Gender,Salary,AadharNo,SalDate,City) 

1) Candidate : Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of a table known as candidate key. 
			Empno, AadharNo

2) Primary : One of the candidate key needs to be chosen as primary key based on priority. 
			Empno

3) Alternate : Any key, that which is candidate key but not primary key known as alternate key. 
			AadharNo

4) Composite : Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of table made up of more than one attribute
		known as composite key. (Empno+SalDate) 

5) Foreign Key

How to display all records from Emp table. 

select * from Emp;

How to display all records from Dept table

select * from Dept;

Project Operator : Used to project only particular attributes. 

-- Display Empno, Ename, job,sal,mgr from Emp table 

select Empno, ename, Job, Sal, Mgr
from emp;


-- Restrict Operator : used to filter the table rows. 

-- Display all records whose sal > 2500;

select * from Emp where sal > 2500;

-- Display info for whose Ename is 'SCOTT' 

select * from Emp where Ename='SCOTT';


-- Display info for whose empno is 7900

select * from Emp where empno=7900;

-- Display all records who works as CLERK (job is 'CLERK') 

select * from Emp where job='CLERK';

-- Between...AND : used to display values from start to end range.

select * from Emp where sal between 1000 and 3000;

select * from Emp where sal NOT between 1000 and 3000;

-- IN Clause : Used to display particular column values

display info whose Ename is SCOTT/FORD/KING


select * from Emp where 
ename in('SCOTT','FORD','KING');

select * from Emp where 
ename not in('SCOTT','FORD','KING');


Display info whose job as MANAGER or ANALYST 

select * from Emp where JOB IN('MANAGER','ANALYST');

Order By : Used to display data w.r.t. Specific field(s) in 
ascending or descending order. 

select empno,ename,job,sal from Emp 
order By ename;


select Empno,Ename,job,sal,mgr from emp
order by job,ename;

select Empno,Ename,job,sal,mgr from emp
order by job,ename desc;

distinct : used to eliminate duplicate entries at runtime. 

select distinct job from Emp;

Write a query as display one column as manager as

    if Job is CLERK then print name as 'Fahrana'
    if job is ANALYST then print name as 'Abhishek'
    if job is SALESMAN then print name as 'Nilesh'
    if job is MANAGER then print name as 'Pavithra'

else give 'No Manager'

select empno,ename,job,sal from Emp;



select empno,ename,job,sal,
case job 
   when 'CLERK' then 'Fahrana'
   when 'ANALYST' then 'Abhishek'
   WHEN 'SALESMAN' then 'Nilesh' 
   WHEN 'MANAGER' then 'Pavithra'
   else 'No Manager'
end "PC" 
 from Emp;



Write a query as display one column as UpdSal as

    if Job is CLERK then Add Sal by 1000
    if job is ANALYST then Add sal by 1500
    if job is SALESMAN then Add Sal by 1800
    if job is MANAGER then Add Sal by 2000

	else give Sal 


select empno, ename, job, sal,
case job
   WHEN 'CLERK' THEN Sal+1000
   WHEN 'ANALYST' THEN Sal+1500
   WHEN 'SALESMAN' THEN Sal+1800
   WHEN 'MANAGER' THEN SAL+2000
   ELSE SAL
end "UpdSal"
from Emp;


select empno,ename,job,sal,comm,
case
   WHEN COMM IS NULL THEN 0
    else COMM
end "UpdVal"
from Emp;



select empno,ename,job,sal,comm,
case
   WHEN COMM IS NULL THEN 0
    else COMM
end "UpdVal",
CASE
   WHEN COMM IS NULL THEN SAL
    ELSE SAL+COMM
END "TakeHome"
